# Chat-with-PDF-project

Flask and a bunch of powerful Python libraries, like Langchain, Streamlit, Transformers, Torch, and many more, were used to make the cutting edge "PDF Chatbot" project. The goal of this project was to completely change how we work with PDF files and get information from them. 
The PDFminer.six library is one of the most important parts of this project. It lets you extract text and data from PDF files, which lets you interact with the information inside them. This data that was extracted can be easily processed, analysed, and shown to users. 
Other tools used in the project to improve the user's experience are language models like Transformers and Sentence Transformers. These models make it possible to process natural language, understand user queries, and give appropriate answers. People can talk to the chatbot and ask it questions or look for information in PDF files in a natural way.
